# How To Compile:   

- make build -- compiles code, needs to be cleaned first 

- make clean -- cleans up currently compiled program 

- make run -- runs program, needs to be built first

# Testing

Unit Tests: 
- tests can be run from within the gradebook program. 
- In the initial dashboard, there will be a test profile option which will allow you  
       to run 8 different tests that will test certain types of invalid input and print out  
       the error message one should expect to receive.  
- Specific tests in the test_cases folder can be edited to change the test  
       This will also automatically create a valid test user for future testing purposes
       
Acceptance tests:
- any acceptance testing can be done by creating a user and giving input
                  and checking for error output
